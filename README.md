# BookingXML
Our Global Travel API platform offers an extensive array of travel business opportunities and tools that enable the worldâ€™s travel technology talent to partner with you and set up new solutions for the world of travel commerce. BookingXML provides seamless integration with all the XML API. We provide real-time fares and availabilities for hotels and other travel-related products to travel agents. It is connected with hotel and other supplier systems in the back-end and manages the distribution of inventory for these providers globally. We provide a unified XML API Interface wherein you can manage your entire third-party supplier inventory from a single window, rather than logging into multiple systems and shuffling through various suppliers to access live fares. This reduces your effort and helps you concentrate on selling more.
